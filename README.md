Would you let a stranger babysit your child?

And yet, we are all. We hope that spending $150 a year on some software product will provide sufficient protection to our children on the internet. I'm afraid we all know the answer to that.

Like a living organism, Internet is growing and evolving every day, contributing to scale of changes so rapid that some parents who are less technical, struggle to understand all dangers that children may be facing while browsing. In the endless sea of new content being created every day and with the sheer number of social apps children can use to express themselves and communicate, how can parents have a standing chance to protect their children?

Not to mention other internet dangers such as cyberbullying, cyber predators, posting private information, phishing, accidentally downloading malware, posts that come back to haunt a child later in life, etc. ([more details](https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/top-seven-dangers-children-face-online))

With almost 20 years of IT experience across software development, data and AI, I am certain that one man or one company cannot possibly come up with a product that can be so comprehensive to cope with scale of problem we are dealing with here. On the other hand, united we can join our technical knowledge and come up with a product which can stand a chance in protecting all children.

Thank you for joining this cause.
